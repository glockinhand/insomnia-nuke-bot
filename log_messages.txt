mhmm... what do we have here? :yum:
a new server? again? really?
someone's gonna be mad about this.
oh no... not again.
you should probably not be here.
is this what you call moderation? :sob:
guess what... too late now.
another one bites the dust.
server said goodbye. :wave:
no survivors.
poof... gone in an instant.
well, that escalated quickly.
bye bye, little server.
and just like that... it's history.
another chapter closed.
oops, did I do that? 😏
vanished without a trace.
say hi to the server graveyard.
snip snip... cut from the list.
was nice knowing you. kinda.
